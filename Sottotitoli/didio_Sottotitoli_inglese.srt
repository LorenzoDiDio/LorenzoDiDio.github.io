00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:10,840
Hello professor, today let's analyze Criterion 2.4.8, Location (Position),

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,300
that is, provide information about the location

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,500
of the user in a series of web pages.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,900
Let's analyze the techniques

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,740
sufficient and additional ones.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,260
Let's go to see them in general first

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,260
and then we will see them specifically with tests.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,660
The first sufficient technique

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,060
is to provide the user with a breadcrumb.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,480
The second is to provide the user with a sitemap.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,760
The third is to indicate your current location

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
in the navigation bars

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
of web pages.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,940
The fourth is to identify

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,380
a relationship with a page,

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,280
with a larger amount of pages.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,260
This technique has a sub-technique

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,400
ie the use of the "link" element, the element "link"

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,100
that is, those tags that are not visible to the user, such as "meta" tags.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,380
Instead the additional techniques are two,

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,480
the first is to provide in a pdf document

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,480
a header and a footer.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,820
The second, instead, consists in specifying

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,380
in a pdf document, the page number.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,080
Now let's see the application

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,380
of sufficient techniques.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,740
This first page shows us a brief

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,660
description of my Criterion and the list

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,560
enough techniques that now

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,360
we will go to see specifically.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Here we see the application of the first

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
technique, breadcrumb navigation,

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,700
which shows the user its location

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,300
within a series of web pages.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,540
A breadcrumb trail displays

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,540
also the path it has taken

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,700
the user to reach a certain web page

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,800
and always allows the user

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,640
to go back to the previous pages.

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,240
Here we have an example, if the user

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,740
wants to go to a certain page

42
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,300
of the website, for example the description

43
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
of the "Scala dei Turchi" for example,

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,960
by clicking this button the user

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,340
he will be told which page he is on

46
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,740
and has a chance to return

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,000
on the previous pages and also

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,080
on the intial page, on the Home page.

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,320
This is the code that allows us

50
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,820
the application of the first technique,

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,560
ie breadcrumb navigation

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,900
It is simply a list it contains

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,800
the location where the user is located

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,900
and moving through the various sections

55
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,980
we find a list that is modified

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,260
where the position is always contained

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,080
of the user, but which allows the user

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,560
to return to the previous pages,

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,300
as we see in all these pages.

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,160
Now, let's see the application of the

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,900
second technique, provide a sitemap.

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,920
A sitemap is a web page that

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,780
allows links to

64
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,560
different sections that can be

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,380
present on a site.

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,500
To give the possibility that this

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,840
sitemap is complete,

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
each web page listed in the sitemap,

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
it must contain a link to it.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,420
The sitemap serves several purposes,

71
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,080
provides a whole overview

72
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,080
of the web page,

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,180
helps users understand what it contains

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,860
the whole site and how it is organized.

75
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,580
And besides, it's very easy to understand.

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,760
Now let's see an example, each section

77
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,540
of a website, has a link

78
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,180
to the sitemap.

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,120
The sitemap is structured like this,

80
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,180
and the various sections listed lead,

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,780
by clicking on the corresponding section.

82
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,260
This is the code that allows us

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,940
the application of the second criterion,

84
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,100
ie the sitemap.

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,500
The sitemap is structured like this,

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,300
that is, a list that contains

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,440
inside it some words

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,980
which are clickable, which lead

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,020
to the various sections of the site.

90
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,560
Each section, inside it, in the bar

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,660
of navigation, contains

92
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,160
a link to the sitemap.

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,080
This is very important

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,200
to allow the user to understand

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,480
its position within the web page.

96
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,280
Now let's see the application

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,920
of the third technique, that is, indicate

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,800
to the user, its position inside

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
navigation bars.

100
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,260
The goal of this technique

101
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,780
it's really helping the user by providing

102
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,520
information about its current

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,960
location in the navigation bars.

104
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,720
This technique is very useful when

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,460
web pages must be

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,860
in a specific order.

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,660
We can provide you with yours

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,040
position through an icon, a text

109
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
or by changing the state of the item.

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,100
In my case I put a colored

111
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,900
background to the section or page

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,500
where the user is located.

113
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,340
Let's go see an example, here

114
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,340
we have our own navigation bar

115
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,380
by section or page

116
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,060
in which the user, the box,

117
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,460
the button where the section is indicated,

118
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,080
will light up, turn blue.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,180
This way the user will know which one

120
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,280
section of the page is located.

121
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,620
This is the code that allows us

122
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,840
the application of the third technique,

123
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,800
that is to indicate to the user, his

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
current location inside

125
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,300
navigation bars.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,720
This is the code. A div that contains

127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,920
inside, clickable words,

128
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,060
which lead to the various sections

129
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,960
of the page. In this case,

130
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,720
description, photos and videos.

131
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
To indicate to the user his

132
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,880
position, I used a class,

133
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,140
in this case, "active", to indicate

134
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,460
to the user who clicks, the button

135
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,220
will turn blue.

136
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,880
In this case it will be very intuitive

137
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
for the user, understand in what position

138
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
of the page, he is.

139
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,280
In fact the button will turn blue if

140
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,780
is in the home, it will turn blue

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,140
if it is in the description section,

142
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,940
in the photo section, in the video section

143
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,280
and so on.

144
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,780
Now, let's see the application of the

145
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,100
fourth technique, one of the last

146
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,900
sufficient techniques,

147
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,640
which identifies the relationship of a

148
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,700
web page with a larger collection

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,880
of web pages.

150
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,140
The goal of this technique is,

151
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,220
allow users to

152
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,660
identify what relationship is present

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,140
between the current web page and others

154
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,600
web pages of the same collection,

155
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
for example on the same website.

156
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,600
In some cases, this can be done

157
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,580
programmatically, for example

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,180
using the "rel" attribute

159
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,060
of the "link" element in HTML.

160
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,320
In other cases the necessary

161
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,720
information are included in the title

162
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,540
of the web page, as in the example

163
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,880
of the "Descrizione Criterio" page.

164
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,280
Indeed the title is "Criterio 2.4.8 Location",

165
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,040
with "Tecniche Sufficienti" next, that

166
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,740
identifies as, the current page

167
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,140
is linked to other pages.

168
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,260
Now let's see the use of "meta" tags

169
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,560
which serve to provide

170
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
additional information,

171
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,060
like the author, the description,

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,420
the topic covered on the page

173
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,960
and also the language.

174
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,140
We also have the option to use

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,440
the "rel" attribute, which allows you to

176
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,380
indicate what relationship there is between a

177
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,900
current document and the document of

178
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
destination "link".

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
We also remember the use of the tag

180
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,080
"link" that allows us to link

181
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,480
of a current page, such as

182
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,580
for an example, with a CSS file or a

183
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,960
page with author information.

184
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,540
However, we must remember that

185
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,780
to work, the "rel" attribute must

186
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
always be accompanied

187
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,920
from the "href" attribute, which identifies

188
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
the destination.

189
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,220
These "link" tags are fully

190
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,980
satisfied with the use of the

191
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,780
technique "H59", which implements the use

192
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,060
"link" tags and navigation

193
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,220
tools.

194
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,380
The goal of this technique is

195
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,720
describe how "link" tags can

196
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,360
provide location information

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,860
of an HTML page, within a

198
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,620
series of extensive web pages or help

199
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,860
the user to locate the content.

200
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,880
The value of the "rel" attributes indicates

201
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,620
what kind of relation is there,

202
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,220
and the "href" attribute provides a

203
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,420
link to current document

204
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,560
with that relation.

205
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,340
The more "link" tags there are, the more they will be

206
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
present information.

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,120
Programmatically I have entered

208
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,080
the "link" tags with the "rel" attribute,

209
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,640
"href" and a "title" attribute, which are for

210
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,620
provide additional information.

211
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,940
For example, I added the main

212
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,140
page, ie "index" and

213
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,740
the previous page.

214
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,060
The "rel" attribute that identifies the

215
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,920
type of connection,

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,220
the "href" attribute that is used to identify

217
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,120
the corresponding resource

218
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,140
and the "title" attribute which provides a title.

219
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,220
Finally, remember that the "link" tags

220
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,360
and "meta", very often do not generate

221
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
no change in the eyes

222
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,960
of the user, but they are very important

223
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,420
for search engines and browsers.

224
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,760
This is the code allows us

225
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,100
the application of the last two

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,060
sufficient techniques, that is

227
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,720
"Identify the relation of a

228
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,580
web page with a larger collection"

229
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,220
and the use of "link" tags.

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,360
Here, in fact, on this page, we see

231
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,400
the use of "link" tags and in the

232
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,060
page "index" we see the use

233
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,060
some "meta" tags and an appropriate title

234
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,640
indicating the relation of the current

235
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,680
page, in this case "index" with

236
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,080
the other pages present.

237
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Now let's see the last two techniques

238
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,260
additional, the first is "provide a

239
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,360
header and footer" in

240
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,960
pdf documents.

241
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,500
The goal of this technique is

242
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,500
to help users understand where

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,140
they are found in a pdf document.

244
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,400
In this case by providing

245
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,840
a header and a footer.

246
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,600
Headers and footers help

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,280
to make the content more

248
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,760
understandable, providing information

249
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,220
repeated consistently.

250
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,980
In this case we see, as for

251
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,420
example can be a title of the

252
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
document, a current chapter,

253
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,740
a general information about the author

254
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,720
in the header. The Decameron,

255
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,920
Chapter VII, Giovanni Boccaccio,

256
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
poet and author of the Decameron...

257
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,300
The second additional technique

258
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,920
specifies the page numbering

259
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,420
in pdf documents, that is simply,

260
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,520
the goal of this technique is

261
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,040
help users understand where to

262
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
find, in a pdf document.

263
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,620
A page number can be entered,

264
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,800
for example, 1, and 2 on the second page

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
or a date.
